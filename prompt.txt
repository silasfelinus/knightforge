Hi, ChatGPT! I'm Silas. I have a vue.js project.
I need your help completing my code.
I'm building a gui development lab that I can use to develop future tools.
My goal is to make something that will allow me to chain api calls to natural language processors
with a friendly and pleasing interface that also looks great as a portfolio showpiece.`
I have the following structure and I'm trying to follow best practices:

[Project]
KnightForge Wonderlab

[INTENT]
A single-screen Vue web app designed to provide a modern, sleek, fast, and friendly sandbox to make programmatic api calls

[Dev Environment]
Ubuntu 22, Visual Studio Code, Chrome, Node LTS 18.15.0

[INSTALLED MODULES]
Vue 3, TypeScript, SCSS, Quasar

[STANDARDS]
Material Design, Composition API, Prettify, SASS

[Structure: Material Design]
Desired Component:Desired Effects

./src/components/HeaderWidget.vue: fixed at top, save/load lab states, create new WonderWidget, manage user login, and toggle night mode.
./src/componenSideWidget.vue: partially collapsible, drag-and-droppable Material Design icons onto WonderLab.
./src/components/FooterWidget.vue: Displays copyright information.
./src/components/ChatWidget.vue: Partially-collapsible component on the left side with Livechat and openai chat integration
./src/components/WonderLab.vue: A grid-based workspace for building, saving, and sharing programmable WonderWidgets, utilizing a step-based save system for easy progress tracking
./src/components/WonderWidget.vue:a draggable, droppable, resizable container


[Key Intended Features]
a coding suite of Draggable, droppable, and resizable components such as drop-down selections, buttons, wires, and data displays
Step-Based Save System
Impressive, functional, modern interface

[Supported File Types]
txt, yaml, json, jpg, png

[CONFIGURED FILES]
./src/styles/ain.scss
./src/styles/variables.scss
./src/styles/_presets.scss
./src/styles/_colors.scss
./.gitignore
./jsconfig.json
./package.json
./README.md
./tsconfig.json
./vue.config.js
./public/index.html
./main.ts

[NOTES]
All colors should reference their Quasar preset variables: $primary, $secondary, $accent, $dark, $dark-page, $positive, $negative, $info, $warning
Use Quasar component if a reasonable option is available


[COLOR VARIABLES]


I have installed Quasar and Vue3 and the website is blank other than a default splashpage.
We have created:
App.vue
HeaderWidget.vue
SideWidget.vue
FooterWidget.vue

Next goals: make chatwindow
fix sidewidget not showing background color
sidewidget should have containers/cards (want advise on best qcomponents to use)
Initial layout should be two stacked containers: a 3x6 grid of small icons, and a 1x3  grid below it of larger square icons, and a thin rectangular bar that doesn't collapse with the containers.
