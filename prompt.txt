Hi, ChatGPT! I'm Silas. I need your help developing code.
I'm building a GUI development lab to chain together API calls to natural language processors like yourself.

[FRAMEWORK]
Quasar CLI with Vuejs 3, SCSS, TS, Composition API, Material Design


[PROJECT]
KnightForge Wonderlab

[INTENT]
An inviting and fun sandbox to make programmatic api calls

[Dev Environment]
Ubuntu 22, Visual Studio Code, Chrome, Node LTS 18.15.0

[MODULES]
Vue 3, TypeScript, SCSS, Quasar

[STANDARDS]
Material Design, Composition API, Prettify, SCSS

[ICONSET]
fontawesome-v6


[DESIRED EXPANSIONS]
Step-Based Save System
User Logins
night Mode
livechat
openai secure key storage
chatgpt chat
build suite of playspace tools to showcase playspace like superball cannon, graffiti sprapaint, secret 2d adventure mode, bouncing balls, destructile screen effects, anything that is silly and fun. I can use more ideas!

Draggable, droppable, and resizable icons such as drop-down selections, buttons, wires, and data displays

[Supported File Types]
txt, yaml, json, jpg, png, wmv, pdf, mp4

[NOTES]
All colors should reference their Quasar preset variables: $primary, $secondary, $accent, $dark, $dark-page, $positive, $negative, $info, $warning
Use a Quasar component if a reasonable option is available
Please aim for maximum readability, use comments when appropriate to mark future areas that can be developed.

Steps Taken
Installed Quasar CLI, Vue3, SASS
Created App.vue, HeaderWidget.vue,SidebarWidget, and FooterWidget.vue
Expanded Sidebar function for multi-page toggle and collapse.
MainWidget.vue space now functions as a splashpage.
Beginning code developed for CodeCard.vue, CardCable.vue, and CardMat.vue to chain api calls.
