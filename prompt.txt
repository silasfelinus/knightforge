Hi, ChatGPT! I'm Silas Knight. I have a vue.js Quasar project.
I'm building a gui development lab that I can use to develop future tools.
My goal is to make something that will allow me to chain api calls to natural language processors
with a friendly and pleasing interface that also looks great as a portfolio showpiece.
I have the following structure and I'm trying to follow current best practices:

[Project]
WonderForge

[INTENT]
An inviting sandbox to make and chain programmatic API calls with a friendly, pleasing interface that also serves as a portfolio showpiece.

[DEV ENVIRONMENT]
Ubuntu 22, Visual Studio Code, Chrome, Node LTS 18.15.0

[MODULES]
Vue 3, TypeScript, SASS, Quasar, Vuex

[STANDARDS]
Material Design, Composition API, Prettify, SASS

[ICONSET]
fontawesome-v6

[ADDITIONAL GOALS]
Step-Based Save System
User Logins
Night Mode
Live Chat
OpenAI Secure Key Storage
ChatGPT Chat
Suite of PlaySpace Tools (e.g., Superball Cannon, Graffiti Spray Paint, Secret 2D Adventure Mode, Bouncing Balls, Destructible Screen Effects, etc.)
Toolshed - Draggable, Droppable, and Resizable Icons (e.g., Drop-down Selections, Buttons, Wires, Data Displays)
[Supported File Types]
txt, yaml, json, jpg, png, wmv, mp4, db, pdf

[NOTES]
Use Quasar preset variables for colors
Use Quasar components when possible
Components should use Vuex store for preset and screen names
Adhere to current TypeScript standards
Maintain code consistency and avoid brittle code
No duplicate code or redundant functions

[File Structure]
Installed Quasar CLI, Vue3, SASS
Created App.vue, HeaderWidget.vue, ScreenWidget.vue, and FooterWidget.vue
Set up variable references and SCSS styling
Created NavigationWidget with Vuex store for screen and preset management
Established naming conventions for components and subcomponents
Imported images for secret and splash screens

[LAYOUT NOTES]
ScreenWidgets should not overlap with header and footer
Components should interact only through Vuex
FooterWidget.vue should always be at the bottom, stretched to both sides

[COMPONENTS]
LabSpace (API Chain Project)

CodeCard.vue
CardCable.vue
CardManager.vue
CardMat.vue
TextInput.vue
RedSwitch.vue
DataUpload.vue
WonderForge (Development Limbo)

LabSpaceWidget.vue
ToolBox.vue
PlaySpace (Silly Widgets, Games, Social Chat)

Paintbox.vue
PaintCanvas.vue
SplashWidget.vue
ChatWidget.vue

[ITERATION]
./src/main.ts
./src/store/index.ts
./src/types.ts
./src/App.vue (qlayout: HeaderWidget; gutter[ScreenWidget(left, small, vertical), ScreenWidget(center, large, square), ScreenWidget(right, small, vertical)]; FooterWidget.)
./src/css/quasar.variables.scss
./src/components/HeaderWidget.vue
./src/components/RemoteWidget.vue
./src/components/ScreenWidget.vue
./src/components/FooterWidget.vue

[STATUS]
Reiterating through files, fixing errors to achieve basic layout functions

[REQUEST, PLEASE]
I'm attaching my index.ts, please examine with a fine-toothed comb, and suggest improvements. All types are to be referenced in types.ts, we want no unnecessary code duplication:
