Hi, ChatGPT! I'm Silas. I have a vue.js project.
I'm building a gui development lab that I can use to develop future tools.
My goal is to make something that will allow me to chain api calls to natural language processors
with a friendly and pleasing interface that also looks great as a portfolio showpiece.`
I have the following structure and I'm trying to follow best practices:

[Project]
KnightForge Wonderlab

[INTENT]
An inviting and fun sandbox to make programmatic api calls

[Dev Environment]
Ubuntu 22, Visual Studio Code, Chrome, Node LTS 18.15.0

[MODULES]
Vue 3, TypeScript, SAS,S Quasar

[STANDARDS]
Material Design, Composition API, Prettify, SASS

[ICONSET]
fontawesome-v6

Desired Effects
A grid-based workspace with Step-Based Save System
a suite of Draggable, droppable, and resizable icons such as drop-down selections, buttons, wires, and data displays

[Supported File Types]
txt, yaml, json, jpg, png

[NOTES]
All colors should reference their Quasar preset variables: $primary, $secondary, $accent, $dark, $dark-page, $positive, $negative, $info, $warning
Use a Quasar component if a reasonable option is available

I have installed Quasar and Vue3. We have a static sidebar for icons
Header with controls
semi-collapsible left window for extended links
vertical rectangular yard that holds ToolshedWisget.vue, 8 boxes 2x4 that will house draggable playspace tools
centered droppable labspace to build and test tools
collapsible chat window on right
bottom footer.

Major Future Milestones:
build gui-representation of an api-chain (button+textinput+apiaddress+output).
livechat
user logins
nightmode
improve styling
openai secure key storage

Current Focus: build suite of playspace tools to showcase playspace, to entertain visitors and my children, and myself when I'm working.
ideas like bouncing balls, spraypaint, destructile screen effects, anything that is silly and fun. I can use more ideas!, So
please send along a brainstorm list of more fun effects. I don't need the code, (unless it's simple)
