Hi, ChatGPT! I'm Silas Knight.
I'm building a gui development lab using Vue3, Quasar, and VueX.
I have the following structure:

[Project]
WonderForge

[INTENT]
An inviting sandbox to make and chain programmatic API calls with a friendly, pleasing interface that also serves as a portfolio showpiece.

[DEV ENVIRONMENT]
Ubuntu 22, Visual Studio Code, Chrome, Node LTS 18.15.0

[MODULES]
Vue 3, TypeScript, SASS, Quasar, Vuex

[STANDARDS]
Material Design, Composition API, Prettify, SASS

[ICONSET]
fontawesome-v6

[ADDITIONAL GOALS]
Step-Based Save System
User Logins
Night Mode
Live Chat
OpenAI Secure Key Storage
ChatGPT Chat
Suite of PlaySpace Tools (e.g., Superball Cannon, Graffiti Spray Paint, Secret 2D Adventure Mode, Bouncing Balls, Destructible Screen Effects, etc.)
Toolshed - Draggable, Droppable, and Resizable Icons (e.g., Drop-down Selections, Buttons, Wires, Data Displays)
[Supported File Types]
txt, yaml, json, jpg, png, wmv, mp4, db, pdf

[NOTES]
Use Quasar preset variables for colors
Use Quasar components when possible
Components should use Vuex store for preset and screen names
Adhere to current TypeScript standards
Maintain code consistency and avoid brittle code
No duplicate code or redundant functions.
Don't repeat variable declarations, find information programmatically

[File Structure]
Installed Quasar CLI, Vue3, SASS
Created App.vue, HeaderWidget.vue, ScreenWidget.vue, and FooterWidget.vue
Set up variable references and SCSS styling
Created NavigationWidget with Vuex store for screen and preset management
Established naming conventions for components and subcomponents
Imported images for secret and splash screens

[LAYOUT]
(qlayout: HeaderWidget; gutter[ScreenWidget(left, small, vertical), ScreenWidget(center, large, square), ScreenWidget(right, small, vertical)]; FooterWidget.)

[LAYOUT NOTES]
ScreenWidgets should not overlap with header and footer
Components should interact only through Vuex
FooterWidget.vue should always be at the bottom, stretched to both sides

[COMPONENTS]
LabSpace (API Chain Project)

CodeCard.vue
CardCable.vue
CardManager.vue
CardMat.vue
TextInput.vue
RedSwitch.vue
DataUpload.vue
WonderForge (Development Limbo)

LabSpaceWidget.vue
ToolBox.vue
PlaySpace (Silly Widgets, Games, Social Chat)

Paintbox.vue
PaintCanvas.vue
SplashWidget.vue
ChatWidget.vue

[MAIN ITERATION FILES]
./src/main.ts
./src/store/index.ts
./src/types.ts
./src/App.vue
./src/css/quasar.variables.scss
./src/components/HeaderWidget.vue
./src/components/RemoteWidget.vue
./src/components/ScreenWidget.vue
./src/components/FooterWidget.vue

[VUEX STORE: State]
leftPreset, mainPreset, rightPreset: current preset per section.
leftVisible, mainVisible, rightVisible: visibility status.
widgetSettings: settings for each preset (title, bgColor).

[VUEX STORE: Getters]
widgetSettings: takes Preset, returns settings.

[VUEX STORE: Mutations]
changePreset: changes preset for side (left, main, right).
nextPreset: cycles to next preset for side.
toggleVisibility: toggles visibility of side.
updateWidgetTitle: updates title of preset.
updateWidgetBgColor: updates bgColor of preset.

[VUEX STORE: Actions]
updateWidgetTitle: updates title of preset.
updateWidgetBgColor: updates bgColor of preset.

[STATUS]
Re-iterating through files, fixing errors and optimizing foundation and integration with VueX store.
All types are to be referenced in types.ts, use index.ts for state management, scss quasar variables for color references
no unnecessary code duplication, find variables programmatically whenever possible

[REQUEST, PLEASE]
Please examine the outline I've sent. Reply with feedback, and let me know whether we should look closer at the index.ts or types.ts files that we just revised, or if we are ready to look at the App.vue with the info provided.
