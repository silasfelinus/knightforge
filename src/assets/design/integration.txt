[INTEGRATION]
Integrate the new component into the project, following the specified file and component modifications. (can we make this a single action with a global component registry?)

//add to appropriate section(s) of /router/index.ts
import ExampleHomepage from '../example/ExampleHomepage.vue';
  {
    path: '/example-homepage',
    name: 'ExampleHomepage',
    component: ExampleHomepage,
  },

//add <ComponentName>to homePage

//Change ComponentStatus to Active in useAppStore/useComponentManager
