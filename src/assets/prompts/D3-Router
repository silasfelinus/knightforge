Make me a new vue router/index.ts file. I would like help organizing this idea.


I want a router file that loads HomePage.vue and then our default homepage components depending on the homepage attributes


LSidebar.vue
RSideBar.vue
TopHeader.vue
BottomFooter.vue
MainScreen.vue
ContainerFrame.vue
ImageFrame.vue
ImageComponent.vue

NavigationMenu.vue
LayerMenu.vue
AccordionGallery.vue
ChatInterface.vue

We'll have meta fields for isActive :boolean, priority :number, and isLayer :boolean. Do I need the frame components at this level? Are there other options that would be good to place into meta? Can you suggest a user-friendly way to handle loading HomePage with various combinations of settings?

Think about what I want, and then suggest a way to structure this.



This is for our art design site, we're going to need areas for a webgallery, print-on-demand giftshop, membership page
