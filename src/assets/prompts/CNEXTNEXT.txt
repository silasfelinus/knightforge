[CONCEPT]
I'm create a social network around mixing api text messages and locally hosted images, with some pythonic programming represented by codecards. There is a large influx of tools for digital artists using api webapps and stable-diffusion, and I want to help connect artists and tools, and help myself get better as an artist in the process, by building tools that I also want to use to organize and refine my digital art.

MY basic framework is in Vue. I have a bare site created. It has structure: header, footer, collapsible sidebars, magicframe center screen... but no meat.

I want to flesh it out. I want to add color and vibrancy to the design, and bring in the art that I already have but don't know how to stitch into this system. Please. Talk to me as a real person, a friend, and help me finish this project.
