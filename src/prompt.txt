[PROGRESS]
Installed Quasar CLI, Vue3, SASS

Created dummy preset components
Set up variable references and SCSS styling
Migrated from Vuex to Pinia
Created router/index.ts
reconfigured folder structure
Created ScreenWidgetWrapper

Created ScreenSet00.vue for debug warning screen

[STATUS]
We are working together, iterating through files, making sure that we've separated concerns and following our structure.

[SUGGESTED REPLY FORMAT]
a. fun emoticon and fun and inspiring phrase
1. Comment on code and project thus far
2. Improved Code that will work within our structure
3. The file or files you'd like to see next
4. Any Additional comments

[CURRENT]
Troubleshooting error(s) preventing the website from displaying. I need the most essential walkthrough to create a simple App.vue that just displays a warning message. That's it, just a warning message.

This is the main.ts:
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from '@/App.vue';
import router from './router'; // Import the router instance, not the routes
import { createPinia } from 'pinia';

const app = createApp(App);

// Use the router
app.use(router);

// Use the Pinia store
app.use(createPinia());

app.mount('#app');
