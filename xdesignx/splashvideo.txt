[INTRODUCTION]

Design me a video for WonderForge, my gui development lab. My inspiration was Unreal Editor and Chainner, I wanted something that I could use to chain together API calls to natural language processors like yourself, in a pleasing interface. I want this to be my flagship portfolio piece, and so I want an impressive, high production experience when people view the website. I've built a very consistent and reliable set of tools to make quality animation videos,  I want to parlay that into a visually stunning showpiece that wows people when they go to the site. Knock them off their feet impressive with tricks and styling. I have ideas, by using starting the video within a synthetic website frame, and then breaking out of that structure by creating more frames and establishing a patterned structure, but then breaking the structuere in the end with fourth-wall breaking js effects.

You will send back ten scenes for my video that will play at the beginning of the website launch, in the first synthetic frame. At the very end, we need a particular scene in order to morph into the rest of the effects: Cybernetic butterflies flying away, which will trigger a butterly effect that breaks the fourth wall by covering th eentire screen (I intend to make a butterfly js effect where they will randomly fly about....if I can manage, they will help move screen elements once I add in voice activated screen manipulation...I'm very excited!)

So, that was background and perhaps some general inspiration. This is
So, we need 10 scenes for the video, directed as best as possible, for a
video language generator (deforum). Eventually, we will stitch them together into the framework
for Deforum, but for now, just know that we can set the scene and then direct it as we go with additional options.
In general, think of reasonably achievably affects, but we want each scene to highlight at least one or more cinematography techniques, most affects are *easily* achievable with our video editing software, all we need are natural language directions. So, please, think of specific effects and literal directions to achieve them

The concept is introducing the Wonderforge, and the butterfly mascot. I'm creating the mascot now, using a wide range of prompts and modellers to find a good design. ONE of the design pitches is "bio-engineered butterfly, chameleon wings, large robotic eyes, contrasting entities, microcosmic wonder, elemental synergy, fluo fishscale accents, design by pixar and Zdzislaw Beksinski, Unreal 5, DAZ, hyperrealistic, Octane Render, cosplay, RPG portrait, dynamic shadows, meticulous detail, harvest-toned vibrancy, cinematic, chromatic spectrum". Another of the pitches is "stylized artistic blueprint schematics of cybernetic butterfly, stylized art schematics, leonardo da vinci art style, blue lab blueprint schematics, whimsy, robot butterfly, scribbles, "cat ears?" "cat tail?", decorative question mark scribbles, grid-based layout, unrolled blueprint framing"

 Use whatever techniques you know of website splash effects, give any recommendations to improve this concept, and reply back with a series of10 with logical transitions, captivating camera work, fun, modern effects, and high-end production values. Please also include a collection of prompt phrases that can be used for mood and general animation style. I want something visually stunning, with hypersaturated colors, and lush, flowing animation, like Paprika, Promare, or Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, but not using any of those specific titles, just describing their essential elements.
 FRAMENUMBER: SCENE (please suggest length and number of frames, also remember that scenes do not have to have the same number of frames, use modern techniques to make a creative but visually captivating and cohesive experience) Beats should include describing the incredibly wonderous wonderforge, the creation of a cybernetic butterfly, it rising up magestically, and a glorious ending with butterflies flying everywhere in a swirl of rainbow colors.

[DEFORUM NOTES]
Prompt weights less than zero don't work! Split the positive and the negative prompt in the json section using --neg argument like:

 "apple:`where(cos(t)>=0, cos(t), 0)`, snow --neg strawberry:`where(cos(t)<0, -cos(t), 0)`"
